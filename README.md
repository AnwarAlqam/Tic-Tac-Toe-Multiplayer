# Tic-Tac-Toe-Multiplayer

A desktop application that expands the ideas of the iconic Tic-Tac-Toe game by adding multiplayer compatibility with up to ten players and an AI gamemode. It uses JavaFX to build its GUI and application as a whole.

Currently the AI uses a min-max algorithm to figure out the best possible move for the AI. This algorithm is not the fastest which is why I welcome any developers to do a pull request.

The online multiplayer functionality uses a server that as of right now a player with have to host. Ideally in the future there will be a server that all players can connect to. The multiplayer functionality uses an Oject Oriented approach as well as the application itself was used to send current game status to the server which it then checks if it the information that was sent was valid or not, then it will send that information to all other players.

# Features not fully working
* The store
  * As of right now the store does not have full functionality to support actual purchases. A database will need to be set up to complete it's functionality.
* Google, Facebook, and Apple login functionality
  * Unfortunately, the login functionality for Google, Facebook, and Apple is not implemented as of right now due to technical difficulties.
